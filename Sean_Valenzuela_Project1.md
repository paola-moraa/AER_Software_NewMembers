Sean Valenzuela

Major: Computer Science

I took rudimentary programming classes in middle school and high school, most notably AP Computer Science Principles in senior year of high school. 

The projects I am mainly interested in helping with are the laser timing gate and the data acquisition system. But since I have not had much experience with programming, I am willing to learn and help out in whatever the team thinks is best fit for me.
