 Benjamin Dennis

Major: Computer Science

Previous Programming Experience: Mostly from classes like 420 and 210. I am also working on on a bare metal stopwatch project onto a STM32Cf103 blue pill chip. Its been great for learning how to write directly to the registers and understand the hardware. I am also writing this on STM32 just without any HAL.


Interested Projects:

BMS Programming: Switch to STM32
Laser Timing Gate
Wiring Harness & CAN
